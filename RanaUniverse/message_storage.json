What about selection among communities, ecosystems, biomes, planets, star systems, galaxies?\n2. The researcher expects to describe or recognize distinct biological populations when sampling is over distinct environments, habitats, biomes, or faunal assemblages.\n3. Explore earth science by picking and studying a specific biome: tundra, taiga, forest, grassland, or desert.\n4. To help identify areas most likely to benefit from conservation dollars, the scientists looked at the world in terms of biomes, or communities of living organisms in a single major ecological region.\n5. We looked specifically for evidence of such movement in Western Tanagers because, as coniferous forest breeders, up-slope movements would take them to more productive habitats in the same biome.\n\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\n\ud83c\udf00 @cambridge_dic"
